                My name is Tyler Truitt and I am a developer.  This project I designed with ASP.NET M.V.C 5 using Entity Framework.
                The database I configured in SQL Server Managment Studio 2012 using a four table datastucture.  I chose to do this shopping cart application on a music store because I am a musician, and I
                believed that that itself would benefit the creativity of the project.  This was the first time that I have built this type of application, and it will not be the last.

                <img style="width:100%;" src="~/Content/CreditLogos/Capture.jpg" />
            </div>



            <p style="width:70%; margin:10px auto;">
                I believed that I have learned a lot while working on this application.  Prior to this I have built a few two tier projects whichcan be viewed at <a href="http://www.trucoding.com/Home/Projects/">this link</a>;
                however, I have not built the shopping cart application with ASP.NET M.V.C 5.  Previously I have done a ticket tracking system, resembling a screen printing shop and orders, but never the shopping cart functionality
                with Model View Controller technology.

                The languages that I used were Razor HTML, Bootstrap CSS, jQuery, Linq, SQL and of Course C#.  I put a great deal of time not only into the server-side functionality, put also into the styling of the page.
                The responsiveness of the webpage was programmed with Bootstrap CSS as well as media queries.  I did not bring in a template, I styled this one completely on my own.  I brought in a logo I designed on photoshop,
                and adjusted all the necessary CSS to style the page to fit the design of a music store.
            </p>
            <p style="width:70%; margin:10px auto;">
                Along with server-side sorting, paging, and search, many various Razor statements were programmed to give a very clean nagivation between webpages.  Alot of Object Oriented Programming concepts I had to learn in order to
                have the program do the neccessary functionality, but I used a few resources to help guide me.  They can be viewed on my <a href="@Url.Action("Credits","Home")">Credits Page</a>.

            <p style="width:70%; margin:10px auto;">
                When I was building out my views of the the specific products, I discovered that in a tile view the height of the webpage would grow with the number of entries.  I needed server side paging to stop this issue,
                and this article provides a great example of server-side sorting and paging in C#.
